<!-- TRANSLATE -->		
<h2>Translate</h2>
<p>All translations are located in app/locale/. Default site language is english, and spanish translation is already included. If you need to translate it to your own language you can do so with just one .po file.</p>

<p>
To translate it into a new language just copy app/locale/spa and rename it according to your language iso639-2 code.
</p>
<pre>
Example: 

spanish		-> spa
french		-> fre
german		-> deu
italian		-> ita
portuguese	-> por
</pre>
<p>
You can get it a list of language codes in <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/English_list.php">http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/English_list.php</a>.
</p>
<p>
Then translate the file default.po into your language Translating the msgstr strings.
</p>
		
<pre>
Example:

msgid "Previous"
msgstr "Anterior"

msgid "Next"
msgstr "Siguiente"
</pre>
		
<p>
<b>Note</b>: translate the msgstr string only and keep the msgid in english.
</p>	
<p>
You can add your own strings to this file if you need to add new multilingual text in your site, then just use the function __(msgid) to translate strings in your html templates.
</p>

<!-- CUSTOMIZE -->		
<h2>CUSTOMIZE</h2>
<p>
Css, javascript and images are placed in the app/webroot folder, but HTML templates are placed in app/views/.
</p>
<p>
The folders you see in app/views/ contain HTML templates you can edit, and the most important one is the layouts/default.ctp file, wich is the main layout used in all the site. Admin uses a different layout named admin_default.ctp and you can edit this files as regular HTML code in any text editor.
</p>
<p>
The homepage template is app/views/nodes/home.ctp
</p>
<p>
The <i>About</i> and <i>Terms and conditions</i> pages are in the app/view/pages/ folder.
</p>
<p>You can also customize the PHP code if you need to. Rikisimo uses MVC provided by the <i>Cakephp framework</i>. Model files are located in app/models, Controllers in app/controllers, and views in app/views.</p>
<h3>Badges</h3>
<p>Users will get badges as they add new listings and reviews. The badges images are in the app/webroot/img and you can replace them all if needed. If you want to change the way they are assigned to the users you should take a look at the app/views/elements/user_badges.ctp file.</p>
